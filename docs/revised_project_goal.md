**Kubernetes-Ready Infrastructure Blueprint for Chatbot System (Python TDD Edition)**

> **Objective:**
> Establish the foundational "utility lines" of connectivity using Python-based service foundations and Test-Driven Development (TDD), merging the original "utility lines" analogy with a focus on simulating the _complete data flow_ (user input → language processing → contextual routing → database query → response). This _skeletal blueprint_ validates the essential connection pathways between a mock chatbot front-end, a mock Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, and supporting database mocks. It leverages the `templates/python_uv` structure to create minimal, containerized implementations with built-in quality controls (via `uv`, `pytest`, `ruff`), explicitly preparing for deployment onto **Kubernetes** using Helm. The goal is not full functionality, but a proven, foundational infrastructure ready for future, full-scale implementation and expansion.

### **1. Core Components & Technologies**

This phase focuses on establishing the following key elements as a minimal, interconnected foundation:

- **Services (Skeletal Mocks):**

  - **Chatbot Service (Mock):** Minimal FastAPI application simulating user interaction and basic LangGraph workflow stubs for MCP communication. _Focus: API endpoint exposure and MCP connection._
  - **MCP Server (Mock):** Basic REST API acting as a central routing hub, connecting the Chatbot Service to appropriate database mocks based on simple logic. _Focus: Routing logic and interface contracts._
  - **Database Mocks (Minimal):**
    - _Neo4j Mock:_ Simulates graph interactions using NetworkX with a skeletal schema.
    - _Weaviate Mock:_ Simulates vector operations using NumPy for essential functions.
    - _Relational Mock:_ Simulates SQL interactions using SQLAlchemy Core with a single table schema and basic Alembic migrations.
      _Focus: Providing minimal, interface-compliant endpoints for connectivity testing._

- **Development Foundation:**

  - **Python TDD Template (`templates/python_uv`):** Base structure for all services.
  - **`uv`:** For fast dependency management and isolated virtual environments per service.
  - **`pytest` & `pytest-cov`:** For unit, integration testing, and enforcing high code coverage (target 90%+).
  - **`ruff`:** For linting and formatting, integrated via pre-commit hooks.
  - **Static Analysis Tools:** `radon` (complexity), `pip-audit` (vulnerabilities).

- **Containerization:**

  - **Docker:** For packaging each service into standardized, portable containers using multi-stage builds for optimization.
  - **Docker Compose:** For orchestrating containers during _local development and integration testing_.

- **Target Orchestration:**
  - **Kubernetes:** The **primary target environment** for deployment, simulating production conditions. (Local setup via Minikube recommended).
  - **Helm:** For packaging, deploying, and managing applications on Kubernetes. Initial Helm chart stubs will be created.

### **2. Service Implementation Layer (Skeletal Focus)**

Implementations will be strictly minimal, prioritizing connectivity and interface contracts over complex logic:

- **Chatbot Service (Minimal Interface):**

  - Basic FastAPI endpoints (e.g., `/chat`) accepting simple requests and returning static or minimally processed responses.
  - LangGraph workflow stubs demonstrating the _intent_ to call the MCP server, without complex state management.
  - Environment managed by `uv`.

- **MCP Server (Basic Routing Logic):**

  - Core REST API routes (e.g., `/route`) to receive requests from the Chatbot Service.
  - Simple logic to determine which database mock to forward the request to based on payload hints.
  - Interface contracts defined for interacting with database mocks (using abstract base classes or similar).
  - Configuration managed via Pydantic.

- **Database Mocks (Essential Functions Only):**
  - **Neo4j Mock:** Basic NetworkX graph manipulation; Cypher-like query interface accepting only predefined, simple queries.
  - **Weaviate Mock:** NumPy operations for simulating vector similarity lookup on a tiny, fixed dataset.
  - **SQL Mock:** SQLAlchemy Core for basic CRUD operations on a single, predefined table; Alembic for initial schema setup.
    _Crucially, these mocks provide the necessary API endpoints but contain no real data persistence or complex query capabilities._

### **3. Validation & Quality Layer**

Rigorous testing ensures the foundational connections are robust:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**

  - `pytest` suites covering all code paths (aiming for 100% path where feasible).
  - `pytest-cov` enforcing >= 90% statement coverage.
  - Hypothesis for property-based testing of core logic components.

- **Integration Verification (Local & Target Prep):**

  - **Local:** Use Docker Compose to spin up all services for integration tests confirming:
    - Chatbot Service ↔ MCP Server handshake.
    - MCP Server → Database Mock routing and basic response handling.
    - Simulated end-to-end request flow validation.
  - **Kubernetes Prep:** Ensure Docker images build correctly and health checks are functional, preparing for Helm deployment tests.
  - OpenAPI schema validation for all service APIs.

- **Static Analysis & Security:**
  - `ruff` checks integrated into pre-commit hooks.
  - `radon` monitoring cyclomatic complexity.
  - `pip-audit` scanning for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### **4. Deployment Preparation (Kubernetes Focus)**

While Docker Compose facilitates local development, the primary goal is Kubernetes readiness:

- **Containerization:**

  - Optimized, multi-stage Dockerfiles derived from the template for each service.
  - Use of security-hardened base images.

- **Orchestration Foundation (Kubernetes & Helm):**
  - **Explicit Goal:** Deployable onto a Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube locally).
  - **Helm Charts:** Develop basic Helm charts for each service, defining:
    - Deployments
    - Services (ClusterIP initially)
    - Basic ConfigMaps/Secrets placeholders
    - Readiness and Liveness probes using implemented health check endpoints (`/health`).
    - Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) definitions for database mocks (even if storage is simulated locally within the container for this phase).
  - Future Ingress configuration will build upon these service definitions.

### **5. Business Context & Future Enablement**

This foundational phase constructs the essential "plumbing" for a sophisticated, multi-purpose chatbot system. By prioritizing the **skeletal structure**, **connectivity**, **TDD**, and **Kubernetes readiness**, we establish a robust, production-grade scaffolding.

**This work directly enables future enhancements by:**

1.  **Proving Core Data Flow:** Validating the path from user input → MCP → database → response.
2.  **Establishing Clear Interfaces:** Ensuring components can be swapped or upgraded with minimal friction (adhering to ISP and DIP).
3.  **Providing a Secure & Tested Base:** Reducing risk when adding complex business logic later.
4.  **Facilitating Cloud-Native Deployment:** Making the transition to a full Kubernetes deployment straightforward using the prepared Helm charts.
5.  **Creating a Launchpad for Advanced Features:** This foundation supports the incremental addition of:
    - Sophisticated language processing models within the Chatbot Service.
    - Advanced routing and context management logic in the MCP Server.
    - Integration with real Neo4j, Weaviate, and SQL databases, replacing the mocks.
    - Implementation of distributed tracing, monitoring, and logging.
    - Scalability improvements leveraging Kubernetes features (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscalers).
    - Development of industry-specific knowledge bases and functionalities.

### **6. Evolution Roadmap**

The Python TDD and Kubernetes-centric approach ensures controlled, quality-driven growth. This initial skeletal system is the critical first step, designed explicitly for expansion. Future iterations will build upon this validated foundation, replacing mocks with real implementations and adding layers of business logic, confident that the core connectivity and deployment patterns are sound.
