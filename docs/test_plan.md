## 4. Integration Tests (P0)

### Service Communication Tests

- Chatbot → MCP communication
- MCP → Database routing
- End-to-end request flow

**Test Cases:**

1. Complete request flow through all services
2. Error propagation between services
3. Request timeout handling
4. Load testing across services

### System Tests

- Full system initialization
- Service discovery
- Error recovery

## Coverage Targets

### Critical Path Coverage (100% Required)

- Chatbot Service:
  - `src/main.py`: Request handling, response formation
- MCP Service:
  - `src/main.py`: Routing logic, database selection
- Database Mocks:
  - Query processing
  - Response formation
  - Error handling

### General Coverage Targets

- Unit Tests: 90% minimum
- Integration Tests: 85% minimum
- End-to-End Tests: Key user paths covered

## Test Dependencies

### Prerequisites

1. Running instances of all services
2. Mock data populated in database mocks
3. Network connectivity between services
4. Test environment configuration

### Test Environment

- Isolated test databases
- Configurable rate limits
- Logging enabled for all services
- Metrics collection for performance tests

## Test Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical path functionality, must be tested before any deployment
- **P1**: Important functionality, should be tested before major releases
- **P2**: Nice-to-have functionality, can be tested as resources permit

## Implementation Notes

1. Use pytest for all Python services
2. Implement fixtures for common test scenarios
3. Use mocking for external dependencies
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline integration
5. Maintain test documentation alongside code

## Implementation Order
