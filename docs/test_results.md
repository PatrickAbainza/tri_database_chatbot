### Implementation Details

1. Service Communication

   - RESTful API communication between services
   - Async/await pattern for efficient request handling
   - Health check endpoints for service discovery
   - Dynamic routing based on query content

2. Error Handling

   - Comprehensive error propagation across services
   - Validation error handling (422 status codes)
   - Service unavailability handling
   - Request timeout management

3. Performance
   - Concurrent request handling (tested with 5+ simultaneous requests)
   - No degradation under rapid sequential requests
   - System remains healthy after stress testing

### Applied Fixes

1. AppArmor Configuration

   - Updated profile to allow inter-container communication
   - Added necessary file access permissions
   - Configured network access rules

2. Dependencies
   - Updated httpx client for async HTTP requests
   - Added proper timeout configurations
   - Implemented connection pooling

### Known Limitations

1. Current Implementation

   - Fixed service ports (8000-8004)
   - Static service discovery mechanism
   - Limited retry mechanisms for failed requests

2. Future Improvements
   - Implement dynamic service discovery
   - Add circuit breaker pattern
   - Enhance retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Add metrics collection for monitoring
   - Implement service mesh for better traffic management

### Troubleshooting Guide

Common Issues and Solutions:

1. Service Communication Failures

   ```
   Issue: Services unable to communicate
   Solution:
   - Verify all services are healthy (/health endpoint)
   - Check Docker network connectivity
   - Verify AppArmor profile configuration
   ```

2. Request Timeout Errors

   ```
   Issue: Requests timing out
   Solution:
   - Check service resource utilization
   - Verify network latency
   - Adjust timeout configurations
   ```

3. Database Routing Issues

   ```
   Issue: Incorrect database routing
   Solution:
   - Verify query classification logic
   - Check MCP service logs for routing decisions
   - Ensure all mock services are responsive
   ```

4. Concurrent Request Failures
   ```
   Issue: System unstable under load
   Solution:
   - Check service resource limits
   - Verify connection pool configurations
   - Monitor system resources
   ```
