# Enhanced TDD Project Setup & Templates

(This is the original ReadMe file for the code base)

## Introduction

This repository serves a dual purpose:

1.  **Setup Scripts:** Provides scripts (`scripts/setup-prereqs.sh`) to quickly install essential development tools (Homebrew, Git, Python, Node.js, uv, VS Code) on macOS.
2.  **Enhanced TDD Templates:** Offers robust, pre-configured project templates for Python and Node.js, designed specifically for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and incorporating best practices like static analysis, security scanning, pre-commit hooks, CI, and Dockerization.

The overall goal is to significantly streamline the initial setup process for a modern, efficient, and quality-focused development environment, allowing developers to focus on writing code and tests sooner.

## Project Philosophy & Goals

- **Purpose:** Provide high-quality, TDD-focused project templates for Python (using `uv` and `pytest`) and Node.js (using Vite, React, TypeScript, and `vitest`).
- **Philosophy:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the standard approach. All contributions and usage should adhere to TDD principles.
- **Key Tools:** Leverage modern, efficient tools like `uv` for Python and `vitest` for Node.js, alongside a comprehensive suite for linting, formatting, analysis, and security.
- **Structure:** Project templates are organized within the `templates/` directory. Each template is self-contained but benefits from the root-level configurations (Makefile, VS Code settings).
- **Details:** For detailed setup and usage instructions specific to each template, please refer to their READMEs:
  - [Python Template README](templates/python-uv/README.md)
  - [Node.js Template README](templates/nodejs-vitest/README.md)
- **Contributing:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS:** This setup is specifically designed and tested for macOS.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools:** Required by Homebrew and Git. If not installed, Homebrew installation will likely prompt you. You can also install them manually: `xcode-select --install`.

## Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository-directory> # e.g., cd tdd-project-templates
    ```

2.  **Open in VS Code & Install Recommended Extensions:**

    - Open the cloned repository folder in Visual Studio Code.
    - VS Code should prompt you to install recommended extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`. Click **"Install All"**. This is crucial for the integrated tooling (linters, formatters, debuggers) to work correctly.

    **Important:** Before running this task, ensure you are inside a Git repository. If you didn't clone the project, run `git init` in the root directory first. The task needs this to install pre-commit hooks.

3.  **Run the Automated Setup Task (Recommended):**

    - Once the project is open in VS Code, use the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for **"Tasks: Run Task"**.
    - Select the **"Run Initial Project Setup"** task.
    - This task automates several key steps:
      - Makes the prerequisites script executable (`chmod +x scripts/setup-prereqs.sh`).
      - Runs the prerequisites script (`./scripts/setup-prereqs.sh`) to install tools like Homebrew, Python, Node, uv, etc.
      - Runs `make setup` to install Python and Node.js dependencies for the templates.
      - Installs root pre-commit hooks (`uv run pre-commit install`).
      - Installs Node.js template pre-commit hooks (`cd templates/nodejs-vitest && npx husky install`).
    - Monitor the integrated terminal where the task runs for any errors.

4.  **Reload VS Code Window (IMPORTANT):**

    - **After the "Run Initial Project Setup" task completes**, it's highly recommended to reload the VS Code window. Use the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for **"Developer: Reload Window"**.
    - This ensures that any PATH changes made by the setup script (e.g., installing `uv` or `node`) are recognized by VS Code and its integrated terminal.

5.  **Manual Setup (Alternative):**
    If you prefer not to use the VS Code task, you can perform the steps manually:
    - **Make the Prerequisites Script Executable:**
      ```bash
      chmod +x scripts/setup-prereqs.sh
      ```
    - **Run the Prerequisites Script:**
      ```bash
      ./scripts/setup-prereqs.sh
      ```
      > **Note:** Review output for errors. If warned about the `code` command, install it via Command Palette (`Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`) and restart your terminal.
    - **Reload VS Code Window:** As mentioned above, reload after the script.
    - **Install Dependencies & Hooks:**
      ```bash
      make setup # Installs template dependencies
      uv run pre-commit install # Installs root pre-commit hooks
      (cd templates/nodejs-vitest && npx husky install) # Installs Node.js pre-commit hooks
      ```

**Summary of Manual Steps Still Required (Even with Task):**

- **Cloning the repository.**
- **Opening the project in VS Code.**
- **Installing Recommended Extensions** when prompted by VS Code.
- **Reloading the VS Code Window** after the setup task finishes.

## Technology Stack / Tooling

## VS Code Integration

The `.vscode/` directory provides workspace-level configurations to enhance the development experience:

- **`.vscode/extensions.json`:** Recommends essential VS Code extensions for Python/Node.js development, TDD, linting, formatting, debugging, Docker, etc. VS Code prompts installation on opening the project.
- **`.vscode/settings.json`:** Configures workspace settings like format-on-save (using Ruff for Python, Prettier for JS/TS), Python testing discovery (`pytest`), and default formatters.
- **`.vscode/tasks.json`:** Defines tasks runnable via the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` -> `Tasks: Run Task`). Includes tasks for running tests, coverage reports, linters, and static analysis tools for both Python and Node.js templates.
- **`.vscode/launch.json`:** Provides launch configurations for debugging tests (`pytest` for Python, `vitest` for Node.js) and application code directly within VS Code's debugger.

## Makefile Usage

A root-level `Makefile` simplifies common development tasks across both templates. It acts as a convenient wrapper around individual tool commands.

**Purpose:** Provide consistent, easy-to-remember commands for setup, testing, analysis, building, and cleaning.

**Key Combined Targets:**

- `make setup`: Installs dependencies for both Python and Node.js templates.
- `make test`: Runs test suites for both templates.
- `make coverage`: Generates test coverage reports for both templates.
- `make lint`: Runs linters (Ruff, ESLint) for both templates.
- `make analyze`: Runs static analysis tools (Radon, CopyDetect, Pydeps, JSCPD, Dependency Cruiser) for both templates.
- `make security`: Runs security vulnerability scanners (pip-audit, npm audit) for both templates.
- `make docker-build`: Builds Docker images for both templates.
- `make clean`: Removes generated files (caches, build artifacts, coverage reports, etc.).
- `make help`: Displays a list of all available targets and their descriptions.

**Note:** The Makefile also contains targets specific to individual templates (e.g., `make test-python`, `make lint-node`). Refer to the `Makefile` or run `make help` for the full list.

## Project Templates

### Python (`templates/python-uv/`)

- **Location:** `templates/python-uv/`
- **Core:** Uses `uv` for package management and `pytest` for testing.
- **Example:** Includes a simple `calculator.py` module with corresponding tests in `tests/test_calculator.py`.
- **Features:**
  - Pre-configured `pyproject.toml` for `uv`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `pytest-cov`.
  - Testing setup with `pytest`.
  - Coverage configuration via `pytest-cov`.
  - Static Analysis integration (Ruff, Radon, CopyDetect, Pydeps) via Makefile/tasks.
  - Security scanning (`pip-audit`) via Makefile/tasks.
  - Pre-commit hooks configured in root `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
  - `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- **Details:** See [Python Template README](templates/python-uv/README.md).

### Node.js (`templates/nodejs-vitest/`)

- **Location:** `templates/nodejs-vitest/`
- **Core:** Uses Vite (with React and TypeScript) and `vitest` for testing.
- **Example:** Includes a simple `Greeting.tsx` React component with tests in `src/components/Greeting.test.tsx`.
- **Features:**
  - Configured `package.json` with scripts for dev, build, test, lint, analyze, security.
  - Testing setup with `vitest`, React Testing Library, and `jsdom`.
  - Coverage configuration via `@vitest/coverage-v8`.
  - Static Analysis integration (ESLint, Prettier, JSCPD, Complexity, Dependency Cruiser) via npm scripts/Makefile/tasks.
  - Security scanning (`npm audit`) via npm scripts/Makefile/tasks.
  - Pre-commit hooks via `husky` and `lint-staged`.
  - `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- **Details:** See [Node.js Template README](templates/nodejs-vitest/README.md).

## Pre-commit Hooks

Automated checks are configured to run before each commit to maintain code quality and consistency.

- **Python:** Uses the `pre-commit` framework. Configuration is in the root `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Hooks include checks like `ruff` (linting/formatting), end-of-file fixing, trailing whitespace, etc.
  - **Setup:** Run `uv run pre-commit install` once in the root directory after cloning.
- **Node.js:** Uses `husky` and `lint-staged`. Configuration is in `templates/nodejs-vitest/package.json` (`lint-staged` section) and `.husky/`. Hooks typically run ESLint and Prettier on staged files.
  - **Setup:** Run `cd templates/nodejs-vitest && npx husky install` once after cloning and running `npm install`. The `make setup` target handles this.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

GitHub Actions workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`:

- `python-ci.yml`: Automatically runs on pushes/pull requests to check the Python template. Executes setup, linting, testing, coverage checks, and security audit (`pip-audit`).
- `nodejs-ci.yml`: Automatically runs on pushes/pull requests to check the Node.js template. Executes setup, linting, testing, coverage checks, and security audit (`npm audit`).

These workflows help ensure that changes integrate correctly and maintain project standards.

## Troubleshooting

- **`code` Command Not Found:** If the `code` command isn't found after running setup and installing via VS Code Command Palette, restart your terminal or source your shell profile (`source ~/.zshrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile`, etc.). See [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).
- **Docker Issues:** Ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and running on your macOS to use any `docker` related Makefile targets or build/run containers.
- **Dependency Graphs (`pydeps`):** To visualize the `.dot` files generated by `pydeps` (Python dependency analysis), you may need to install Graphviz: `brew install graphviz`. Then use a command like `dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png`.
